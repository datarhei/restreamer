# Network Switch

A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. Unlike less advanced network hubs, a network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► A network switch is a helper if you dont have enough RJ45 connectors, it is easy to extend your connectors with this hardware.
