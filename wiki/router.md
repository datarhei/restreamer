#Router
A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>  

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► You have to forward TCP port 8080 and 1934 for the direct streaming on your website with Datarhei. Keyword for searching how portforwarding works in your router is: YourRouterName + Porforwarding). Only with these 2 ports forwarded  the iFrame can communicate with your Datarhei.
