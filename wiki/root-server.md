title: Root-Server
---

A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in
the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD).
The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating (resolving) human
readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.
