#Streaming Service
Video hosting services are websites or software which allow users to distribute their video clips. Other kinds of websites such as file hosting services, image hosting services and social network services might support video sharing as an enhancement to their primary mission, but in general they are not listed here. Many services have options for private sharing and other publication options. Video hosting services can be classified into several categories, among them: user generated video sharing websites, video sharing platform / white label providers and web based video editing. Websites that are solely search engines and do not host their video content (such as Singingfish) are not included. Some services may charge a fee, but most are available for free. Some websites offer commercialization features, such as partnership programs and the ability for users to offer pay-per-view for their videos. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_hosting_services" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
