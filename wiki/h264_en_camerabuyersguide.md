#H.264
H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC) is a video coding format that is currently one of the most commonly used formats for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content. The final drafting work on the first version of the standard was completed in May 2003, and various extensions of its capabilities have been added in subsequent editions.
H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is a block-oriented motion-compensation-based video compression standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The project partnership effort is known as the Joint Video Team (JVT). The ITU-T H.264 standard and the ISO/IEC MPEG-4 AVC standard (formally, ISO/IEC 14496-10 – MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding) are jointly maintained so that they have identical technical content. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>  

**Datarhei Hint** ☺ ► For the use of Datarhei/Restreamer it is best to have a video stream in H.264 Input. If your network camera has no H.264 support, you need your video stream in H.264 convert (Encoding).
