You want to buy you a network camera and want to know what is needed for operation with Datarhei/Restreamer?  

The following basic data should be a function in your camera:  
**1. [RTSP](rtsp en) protocol**  
**2. [H.264](h.264 en) video output**  
**3. Network connection via WiFi / LAN / 3G / 4G / WAN**  

**Datarhei Hint** ☺ ► 720p (1280x720 px) resolution is a good measure of streaming video on the internet. YouTube & Ustream accept any video live streams at 720p or higher.
